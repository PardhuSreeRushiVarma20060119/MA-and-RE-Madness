# Steps for Base Installation & REMnux
## Setting Up a Minimal Ubuntu Base for REMnux

If you're looking to recreate the lightweight environment provided by the REMnux pre-built virtual appliance, start with the **64-bit minimal Ubuntu 20.04 ISO** installation file.

---

### Step 1: Download Ubuntu 20.04 Mini ISO

Download the Ubuntu 20.04 mini ISO image.  
Verify the integrity of the ISO using the SHA-256 hash:

```
0e79e00bf844929d40825b1f0e8634415cda195ba23bae0b041911fde4dfe018
```

---

### Step 2: Install Ubuntu 20.04

Install Ubuntu using the downloaded ISO installer.  
You can follow the default settings, but adjust them as needed.

> **Note:** If you're installing Ubuntu in a virtual machine, allocate resources accordingly. REMnux is lightweight, but more RAM/CPU improves performance.  
> The official REMnux virtual appliance ships with:
> - **4 GB RAM**
> - **60 GB Disk**

---

### Step 3: User Configuration

When prompted by the Ubuntu installer to create a user, use the following:

- **Full name**: REMnux User  
- **Username**: `remnux`  
- **Password**: `malware`

This keeps your environment consistent with the default REMnux setup.

---

### Step 4: Software Selection

At the **Software selection** screen, **do not select any packages**.  
Simply press **"Continue"**.  
The REMnux installer will handle all package installations later.

---

### Step 5: First Boot

Boot into your newly installed Ubuntu system.  
Log in using the credentials you specified (`remnux` / `malware`).  
You should now see the terminal prompt.

You're ready to install REMnux on this minimal Ubuntu base.
