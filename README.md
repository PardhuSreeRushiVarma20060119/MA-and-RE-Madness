## 🧬 What is This Repo?

**MA & RE Madness** is a curated, evolving collection of everything I explore in the fields of:

- 🦠 **Malware Analysis**
- 🛠️ **Reverse Engineering**
- 🔬 **Static & Dynamic Binary Inspection**
- 🧪 **Behavioral Analysis**
- 💻 **Disassembly / Debugging**
- 🧰 **Tool Configs & Custom Scripts**

This isn't a project—it's a **reference lab**, a **playground**, and a **documentation trail** for my learning and experiments.
